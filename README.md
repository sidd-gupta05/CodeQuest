LabSphere is a modern web platform for managing **labs, doctors, and patients** with seamless authentication, booking, and verification flows. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), it provides a scalable and responsive application foundation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

You can start editing the UI by modifying files in the `app/` directory (e.g., `app/page.tsx`). The app will auto-update as you make changes.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font).
